Delicious, good presentation, very flavorful, clean, and friendly! The service was a little slow but worth the wait! We will def go back!If you don’t have cocktails it is more 10-20$ per person!",

The injera was so spongy and had a wonderful slightly sour taste. I think about this meal a lot and I'm looking forward to dining at Bole again soon.",

My partner and I go there for lunch, take our time eating and drinking coffee and make a day of it. The prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality, especially if you’re getting a dish to share for two or more. The staff has always been super friendly.",
